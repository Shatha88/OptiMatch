## Introduction

OptiMatch is a job placement website that supports the official career center for over 750 universities worldwide using a matching tool connecting students and companies.

### User Story
As an analysts team, we want to analyze the OptiMatch funnel for the product team to enhance student job placement, so that we can improve and provide better opportunities for students.

## The Analysis
### Hypotheses

These points collectively highlight various aspects that influence student job placement through OptiMatch:

- Opt-In Rate: The accessibility of the system significantly impacts the opt-in rate, reflecting the ease with which students engage.

- Profile Completeness and Engagement: Students with comprehensive profiles, including uploaded resumes and active participation with job offers, enhance their chances of securing placements.

- Shortlisting Process: Optimizing the shortlisting process directly correlates with improved job placement outcomes, emphasizing the importance of efficient selection procedures.

- Impact of Career Centers: Educational institutions with dedicated career centers play a pivotal role in the shortlisting process, contributing positively to job placement initiatives.

### Recommendations

- We suggest extending the response window for students from 3 days to 7 days or enhancing communication by diversifying notification channels to reach students more effectively.
  
- Encouraging schools to establish career centers can significantly impact job placement outcomes.
  
- Encouraging students to complete their profiles and upload resumes by offering free resume templates tailored to different industries and career paths.
